This project analyzes customer sentiment and key insights from English reviews of popular e-commerce applications (AliExpress, Alibaba, Jiji) scraped from the Google Play Store. It leverages Python for data processing, NLP, machine learning, and Streamlit to create an interactive dashboard for visualizing the findings.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to extract, analyze, and visualize customer sentiment and insights from Google Play Store reviews for AliExpress, Alibaba, and Jiji. By employing data science techniques, this project uncovers patterns in user satisfaction, common topics of discussion, and trends over time.

## Features

*   **Data Scraping:** Python scripts to collect reviews using `google-play-scraper`.
*   **Data Storage:** Utilizes SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for structured data storage.
*   **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Comprehensive text cleaning (NLP) and data preparation using Pandas, NLTK.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis of review volume, ratings, review length, common words/phrases, and sentiment using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
*   **Machine Learning Modeling:** Development and evaluation of sentiment classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) using Scikit-learn to predict review sentiment from text.
*   **Interactive Dashboard:** A user-friendly web dashboard built with Streamlit, allowing users to:
    *   Select an app (AliExpress, Alibaba, Jiji).
    *   View overview statistics (total reviews, average rating, sentiment breakdown).
    *   Explore rating and sentiment distributions.
    *   See top unigrams, bigrams, and a word cloud for the selected app.
    *   Analyze sentiment trends over time.
    *   Read sample reviews for each sentiment category.

## Technologies Used

*   **Languages:** Python
*   **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `vaderSentiment`, `beautifulsoup4`, `requests`, `selenium`, `streamlit`, `pyodbc`, `wordcloud`, `jupyter`
*   **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
*   **Web Scraping:** `google-play-scraper`
*   **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code (or similar)
*   **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-app-review-analysis.git
    cd ecommerce-app-review-analysis
    ```
2.  **Set Up Python Environment:**
    *   It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **(If applicable) Set up SQL Server:**
    *   Ensure you have SQL Server and SSMS installed.
    *   Create a database (e.g., `PlayStoreReviewsDB`) and the `AppReviews` table using the schema defined in your methodology.
    *   Update database connection details in `scraper.py` if running the scraper.
5.  **(If running Scraper) Run the Scraper:**
    *   Update connection details in `scripts/scraper.py`.
    ```bash
    python scripts/scraper.py
    ```
6.  **Run the Dashboard:**
    *   Ensure `cleaned_reviews_data.csv` is available (either generated by running the notebooks or placed in the project directory).
    ```bash
    streamlit run scripts/dashboard.py
    ```

## Key Findings (Brief)

*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Identified key drivers of positive and negative sentiment for each app.
*   **Review Trends:** Observed review volume trends and potential correlation with external events.
*   **App Comparison:** Compared user satisfaction (ratings, sentiment) and discussion topics across AliExpress, Alibaba, and Jiji.
*   **Model Performance:** Evaluated machine learning models for automatic sentiment classification.

## Deliverables

*   Python scripts for scraping and dashboard.
*   Jupyter Notebooks for data cleaning, EDA, and modeling.
*   Interactive Streamlit Dashboard.
*   Documentation (Methodology, EDA Summary).
*   Final Project Report (PDF) *(Add if you create one)*.
*   Presentation Slides (PDF) *(Add if you create one)*.
*   Dashboard Demonstration Video *(Add if you create one)*.

## Challenges Addressed

*   Web scraping complexities and data storage.
*   Extensive text cleaning and preprocessing.
*   Handling class imbalance in sentiment data.
*   Creating insightful visualizations from text data.
*   Building an interactive and informative dashboard.
